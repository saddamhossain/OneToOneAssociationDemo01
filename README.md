The bank needs a system to manage customer profiles along with their associated credit cards. Each customer should have a credit card that includes details such as the card number, expiration date, and credit limit.

The system must verify if a credit card is valid by checking its expiration date. Additionally, the system should track a customer’s available credit after purchases and allow for the calculation of outstanding balance based on the credit limit and spending.

The system must also ensure the customer’s eligibility for credit based on their age and financial standing.
